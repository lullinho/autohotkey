You should try using Greenshot, or it's more feature filled brother ShareX.
Really great screenshot tools that make screenshots instant and don't require scripting or waiting for a window to close/open.

Also, There's a fantastic AHK script made by Joe Glines that can take screenshots, save them locally, add them to outlook email, OCR the text in the screenshot, and pin your screenshot to the screen. I've been using this as part of my daily workflow ever since I discovered it. LINK: https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=12088&p=259581#top
